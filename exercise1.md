The team works with Java. In my research I found a large number of possible tools for each of the needed tasks (linting, testing and building).The criteria to which the choice of tools was based on was that I wanted to choose tools that were popular. Being a popular framework means that it is easier to find help if a problem arises. The linting tool is Checkstyle. For testing I would choose JUnit. For the build task a good option seems to be Apache Maven.

As for what is the CI setup. There are multiple alternatives for Jenkins and GitHub Actions. For example, Circle CI, Travis CI and Buddy. According to some statistics that I found from the web Circle CI and Travis CI are popular. There are some differences between these frameworks. For example, one that is called Nevercode seems to be targeted to mobile developers. I would assume that which setup should one use is dependent on what kind of application one is developing, who are the developers (are there already at least some familiarity) and the possible distinctive needs for the application. Hence, the choice is not only between self-hosted and cloud-based systems. It is also about choosing the most practical setup in particular environment. 

The definition was that the application is worked on by a team of about 6 people. I think that this means that it is a large project. From the material we found out that cloud based CIs are good if the project is medium sized. I would argue that in this case cloud based environment would be adequate. I think that to finalize this choice would be to know how large the project actually is and if there are any special requirements.
